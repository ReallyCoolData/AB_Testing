## Project - Analyze AB Test Results

## Description of project
For this project, you will be working to understand the results of an A/B test run by an **e-commerce website**. Your goal is to work through this jupyter notebook to help the company understand if they should implement the new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.
